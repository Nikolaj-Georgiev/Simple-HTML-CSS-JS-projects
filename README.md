This is a repo where I am collecting simple projects that I've made to practice and develope my coding skills

1. Roll-Dice-Simulator you can check here: https://dice-roll-sim.netlify.app

2. Space Invaders. You can check them here: https://space-invaders-basic.netlify.app
- Have in mind:
- The game starst directly. The button is to restart it when it's over.
- You can move your spaceship with left and right arrow on the keyboard and shoot with the space button.
- The game is not phone friendly. :( (yet)

3. Space Ivaders 2 :) You can check the new version here: https://space-invaders-gnikolay.netlify.app
- The game is made to be used on any device.
- There is a slow auto shoot but you can shoot additionaly with the left mouse button or (if you use it on mobile device) with thouch.
- It's easy to make more score on smaller screens beacause the number of enemies grows with the screen :)
- There are some flaws in the design but this is my first project with canvas, and I know that it's not perfect, but I hope it's fun! :)

4. Winters. -> Landing page for a winter tours company. You can check it here: https://winters-ngn.netlify.app
- This project is build with advanced CSS techniques using SCSS

5. Omnifood. -> Landing page for a food company. You can check it here: https://omnifood-ng.netlify.app
- This project is build with pure CSS and a few lines of JS
